OWASP Lahore
-----------
In past years we have organized many infosec meetings as a small group in coffee shops in Qatar and built a great community full of enuthusiastic members who are willing to share the knowledge towards the community. We were looking for a ways how to make it possible for you to meet more often than three times per year.
